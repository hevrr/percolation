Manual for Percolation

Note: Please take a look at my UF_WriteUp!

Percolation.java
- Opens, checks if open, checks if full, checks if percolates

UnionFind.java
- Abstract class includes three UFs for ease of comparison
- Can quickly change UF used, including:
- QuickFind.java
- QuickUnion.java
- QuickUnionPC.java
- WeightedQuickUnion.java
- WeightedQuickUnionPC.java
- PercolationRunner.java
- PC: path compression to link sites to root

PercolationRunner.java
- Runs percolation simulation for a specified n-by-n grid for specified cycles
- Reports statistics including time, average percolation probability, standard deviation, and confidence intervals of various cycles

PercolationGraphicsRunner.java
- Graphically demonstrates percolation and reports similar statistics
- Capped out at 20 x 20 grid for computer to handle graphics
